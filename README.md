# Text-Generation-RNN

This all started when I saw the Tensor Flow tutorial for Text Generation using a Recurrent Neural Network.  After doing the tutorial
using the Shakespeare data set I was thinking of a new data set to use.  The new data set I wanted to use was Twitch Chat.  I abstracted the Tensor Flow tutorial into a command line input where you can create or load a model and use it to generate text.
